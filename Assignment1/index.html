<!--- aimed for simple layout of questions with a headeing and paragraph under each question-->
    <h5>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h5>
    <p>Just the movement of everything on screen, everthying felt smooth and fluid, not clanky or anything of the sort. I really appriciated that first interaction of the worlds following your cursor.</p>

    <h5>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h5>
    <p>Scrolling and reading the information, interacting and viewing the virtual P.O.V models. watching the slide show videos. </p>

    <h5>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h5>
    <p>Exploring the models in 3D, felt I was interacting and phycally engadging with what I was reading about.</p>

    <h5>4) What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h5>
    <p>Scrolling, to view more you had to scroll. other than scrolling viewing the 3D models that was the most interactive and engadging part of the experience.</p>

    <h5>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h5>
    <p>To learn about the design choices behind the Walt Disney Concert hall's architecture. This website is very educational, its prime focus and goal is to teach yu things about the concert hall.
      The website places you in a position where you are excited to learn, being succesfull in it's intended experience.
    </p>

    <h5>6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h5>
    <p>Through scrolling down you are constantly shown new information and short videos and new sounds and audio clips, communicatig it's goal of getting you to want to learn new things.

    </p>

    <h5>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h5>
    <p>This is defiently a short one time experience. I read everything and inteacted with the videos and 3D models in around 10 minutes. Unless you are using this for research a user wouldn't spend more than 10-15 minutes on this website.

    </p>

    <h5>8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h5>
    <p>The creators of this website where defiently aware of the nature of is over time use, concluding this website thanking many peeople, concluding the experience.
       Users such as myself did scroll back up to play around with a few more 3D models, and revisit some of those information pieces.</p>

    <h5>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h5>
    <p>Music plays throughout the exprience accompanied by 3D models with interactive viewing.</p>

    <h5>10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h5>
    <p>In refernece to the music, this causes users to get excited and eager to explore the website building anticipation throughout the experience.</p>

    <h5>11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h5>
    <p>The 3D model viewing experience places the users in direct interactive experiences, engadging the users to want to learn more about the scupltures they have been exploring.</p>

    <h5>12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h5>
    <p>The scrolling was cool at first, but then after a while I got pretty sick of it, It's to much of a repititive motion to do for the whole experience, maybe if certain section where broken up where you would scroll and then you wouldn't it would make it a less fatigue inducing exprience.</p>

    <h5>13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h5>
    <p>Again I would say the scrolling also made it satisfying at the same time. seeing the images change as you scrolled through, sooming in, panning across made the experience super immerive. I think the length was just a little bit to long is why it was frustrating </p>
